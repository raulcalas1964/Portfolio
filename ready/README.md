# Portfolio
This is my portfolio to showcase my projects, programming skills, and experience in IT solutions.

My name is Raul Pablo Calas Ravelo. I’m originally from Cuba and have been living in the USA since March 2023.
I’m a software engineer with many years of experience in software development.

I have built applications for data management over WAN and LAN, using distributed databases on remote servers such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle.

I’ve also developed automated solutions for access control systems using digital devices.

I enjoy researching new areas that require software tools and testing emerging technologies — for example, building prototypes in the Arduino ecosystem.

I love integrating information from various sources to create a unified data center, enabling effective data analysis and decision-making.

My strongest skills are in the database field. I can write complex queries, stored procedures, and link servers because I have strong expertise in T-SQL.

Recently, I became a QuickBooks developer.

Throughout my career, I’ve always been driven to identify problems and needs — and provide the software tools to solve them.
